# Each player starts with the same basic stats.

# Then the player picks a character class and gets an upgrade accordingly.

# 2 problems. 1. the character_classes hash uses symbols as keys -> the user input needs to be transformed from a string to a symbol -> conversion error
# 2. Hash#merge is returning new hash that merged the data from both hashes -> here we need Hash#merge!. This mutates the original hash.
