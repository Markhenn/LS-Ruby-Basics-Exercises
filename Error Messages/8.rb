# The following code throws an error. Find out what is wrong and think about how you would fix it.

colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green', 'dark blue', 'turquoise']
things = ['pen', 'mouse pad', 'coffee mug', 'sofa', 'surf board', 'training mat', 'notebook']

colors.shuffle!
things.shuffle!

i = 0
loop do
  break if i == things.length || i == colors.length

  if i == 0
    puts 'I have a ' + colors[i] + ' ' + things[i] + '.'
  else
    puts 'And a ' + colors[i] + ' ' + things[i] + '.'
  end

  i += 1
end

# break is executed 2 steps to late, when i == colors.length, there is no color to pick anymore. Therefore the out of range error.
# but color has one more item in the array than things, therefore things should determine the end of the loop.
# replace line 11 with: break if i == things.length
